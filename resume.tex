\section{Selected Work Experience}
\begin{tabular}{r|p{11cm}}

\textsc{Feb 2020 - Current} & Dependable Computing, LLC \\
& \emph{Principle Scientist}\\ 
& \footnotesize{Working on a team building tools to support the development of provably-safe software for safety-critical systems. The work is sponsored by a grant from the Air Force Research Laboratory's Autonomy Research Collaboration Network (ARCNet). The tools are designed for those who build software that operates systems whose failure would have severe economic or physical consequences (up to, and including, loss of life). }\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{ } \\

\textsc{Feb 2019 - Feb 2020} & Lighthouse Labs \\
& \emph{Mentor (Part-Time)}\\ 
& \footnotesize{Tutored students as they advanced through an in-person introduction-to-software-development bootcamp. Reinforced classroom lessons and taught industry best practices during students' independent work time. Answered questions about take-home work assignments and mentored students as they looked for jobs.}\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{ } \\

\textsc{Feb 2019 - Feb 2020} & Mozilla Corporation \\
& \emph{Senior Performance Engineer}\\ 
& \footnotesize{Analyzed and improved the performance of the Firefox web browser. Worked especially closely with the new, yet-to-be-released Firefox web browser for Android. Participated in international committees that are developing performance standards for the web. Assisted with Mozilla community outreach programs geared toward introducing minorities to careers in software development.}\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{ } \\

\textsc{Apr 2018 - Feb 2019} & Department of Computer Science - University of Virginia \\
& \emph{Research Scientist}\\ 
& \footnotesize{Worked with a team of researchers on several NSF- and DoD-funded projects in software reliability and network security. Participated in the CFAR (Cyber Fault-tolerant Attack Recovery) program which focused on analysis and transformation of binary programs (i.e., having no access to the program's source code or debugging symbols) to increase their safety, security and reliability. Used the static binary rewriter toolkit developed during my PhD research. Work involved understanding what makes software unreliable and vulnerable to attack (at the binary level) and used the static binary rewriter to address those shortcomings. Participated in the CHASE (Cyber-Hunting at Scale) program whose goal it was to develop technologies ``to detect and characterize novel attack vectors, collect the right contextual data, and disseminate protective measures both within and across enterprises.'' Work involved recreating and understanding malware campaigns, worms and botnets; gathering data for use in machine learning algorithms; mentoring and managing other researchers.}\\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{ } \\

& \footnotesize{Participated in development of OTI’s Commotion software project – a State Department- and Radio Free Asia-funded free, open-source communication tool that uses mobile phones, computers, and other wireless devices to create decentralized mesh networks – on embedded devices for the OpenWRT platform and led its development for Android-based devices using public Android SDKs and reverse-engineered functionality. Participated in three international Commotion deployments – one in India, and two in Tunisia - and supported a domestic deployment in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Contributed code to the Linux kernel to support an Ad-Hoc encryption mechanism known as Symmetric Authentication of Peers. Performed data analysis for OTI’s MeasurementLab platform – a consortium of research, industry, and public interest partners dedicated to providing an ecosystem for the open, verifiable measurement of global network performance – using Google BigQuery. Debugged and contributed code to the Internet2’s Network Diagnostic Toolkit server and client to achieve MeasurementLab platform goals. Co-authored successful grant applications to Radio Free Asia, the United States Agency for International Development and the United States State Department worth several million dollars. Mentored two student interns for the GNOME Outreach Program for Women.}\\

Co-authored academic and government papers on protocols and software related to dynamic discovery of Type 1 IP encryptors for DISA. Developed handheld situational awareness applications for iPhone and Android devices using public SDKs and reverse-engineered, unpublished APIs. Deployed and debugged high speed data connections using UDP-based Data Transport, an application-level protocol ``which is fast over network
s with high bandwidth delay products, fair to other high volume data streams, and friendly to TCP-based flows.`` Developed Geographic Information System (GIS) software for iPhone and Android devices. Developed software in support of new Session Initiation Protocol based architectures. Tested and measured network design patterns and implementations.
